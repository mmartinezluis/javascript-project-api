# StoQuotes API
This is the RESTful Ruby on Rails API server for the StoQuotes app [frontend](https://github.com/mmartinezluis/stoquotes-frontend) repository. StoQuotes is an app that allows users to get quotes from a rich variety of methods, and write stories that may relate to those quotes.

## Functionality
This API is designed following the MVC and REST design patterns. The API uses the [Blueprinter serializer](https://github.com/procore/blueprinter) for easily rendering models associations in json format. The database for the API is retreived from [BrainyQuotes.com](https://www.brainyquote.com). You may follow the directions provided in the frontend repo for installing this API in your local machine.
